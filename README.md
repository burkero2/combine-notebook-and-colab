# Jupyter notebook
* Json file
* You need a tool to "see" this file as as set of cells, either text or code cells
* It is language agnostic and it supports execution environments (aka kernels) in several dozen languages among which are Julia, R, Haskell, Ruby, and Python
* When you run a notebook, you create a session
* You can create and share documents/notebooks that contain live code, visualizations and narrative text.

# Google colab
* Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows you to run jupyter notebook, so you can write and **execute python live code** in the browser.
* It is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.
* Offers GPU and TPU
